### :whale: Container Images (ghcr)

```console
$ docker run -d \
    --name autodelete \
    -v config.yml:/autodelete/config.yml \
    -v ./data/:/autodelete/data/ \
    --restart=always \
    ghcr.io/lrstanley/autodelete-docker:latest
```

### :computer: Simple Windows Execution

If you'd like to use a script to handle everything for you, simply follow these steps:

1. Copy the `autodelete-windows` folder from this repository, into a directory locally.
2. Run `start.bat`, it will generate the config file. Update it with your configuration.
3. Re-run `start.bat`, it will download the latest autodelete binary, and then start the bot.

### :computer: Linux

```console
# download the appropriate binary for your platform, e.g:
wget -O autodelete-bot https://liam.sh/-/gh/dl/autodelete-docker/latest/autodelete_linux_amd64 # x86-64
wget -O autodelete-bot https://liam.sh/-/gh/dl/autodelete-docker/latest/autodelete_linux_arm   # arm

# make the binary executable, so you can run it:
chmod +x autodelete-bot

# add your configuration:
vim config.yml # or nano config.yaml

# run the bot:
./autodelete-bot
```

### :toolbox: Build From Source

Check out the steps within the `Dockerfile`, or the [source repos build documentation](https://github.com/riking/AutoDelete/blob/master/docs/build.sh).
